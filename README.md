Four Mountains
==============

Four Mountains is an application of the Analytic Metaphysics of Quality. It simulates the behavior of agents that may have biological or social needs and intellectual priorities. In the existing versions the agents synchronize their data in a centralized manner. For more info: http://wiki.moq.fi



Goals
=====

The Analytic Metaphysics of Quality is a metaphysical theory which, according to Antti Kukkonen (MA, M.Soc.Sci), is an important contribution to process philosophy. Its development began as an attempt to:

- Solve the problem of induction.
- Unify the two metaphysical theories presented by Robert Pirsig in *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* (1974) and *Lila* (1991).
- Create a general theory of emergence.
- Create a standard model of metaphysics.

Unexpectedly, this research produced *the Grid* that behaves like a Cartesian coordinate system with regards to vector summation. Four Mountains interprets this Cartesian coordinate system to simulate the natural behavior of animals with varying degrees of consciousness and moral reasoning ability, varying qualities of character and varying degrees of malleability of character. Decision making is influenced by random factors whenever several choices appear equally good so identical starting conditions frequently develop into completely different situations after a few turns.



Current Goals
=============

As soon as the Four Mountains core works, one goal is to write several artificial intelligences based on the Analytic Metaphysics of Quality and to write a statistical comparison tool for evaluating which strategies, and which combinations of strategies (on different agents) work best.

Another goal is to implement a model of the spatial world into Four Mountains. This would allow computer-controlled characters in a virtual environment to spontaneously express emotions, form friendships, have arguments, specialize in different roles, form a heterarchy, increase or reduce the social authority of each other, split into subgroups according to friendship instead of plan and so on. What kind of friendships are sought after can be affected by external factors. Such as, if a computer-controlled character wanted to have fun, they might seek the company of "party people" characters, and if they wanted to learn things they might seek the company of characters who have intellectual authority.

A more long-term goal is to make computer-controlled characters behave in a way that resembles natural behavior about as much as playing "Guitar Hero" resembles actually playing the guitar. This is enough to make a human able to intuitively understand how the computer-controlled characters feel and how they should be approached.

Four Mountains might add unprecedented depth to computer games, as computer-controlled characters are generally only able to move in a controlled manner, to fire weapons and perform other actions that require no social skill and to perform prescripted events. It also provides an alternative, innovative model for magic that would differ from the traditional concept in which spells are usually like firearms except that they can't be stolen and mana points are like ammunition.



Future Goals
============

Four Mountains relies mostly on simple arithmetic and can thus be used to model large quantities of conscious agents despite the fact that this exponentially increases the amount of some calculations. The features that have so far been implemented could, with reservations, be considered to belong to the Top--Down approach towards Artificial Intelligence. However, they can be combined with a Bottom--Up approach that recognizes patterns and places them within the Grid so that the Top--Down-model can evaluate them and act accordingly.

Lately, some issues regarding the safety of Artificial Intelligence have been raised in the media. From a game theoretic point of view, it is possible to create an Artificial Intelligence relying on Four Mountains that can be deductively proven safe. "Safe" means that it can be proven that the Artificial Intelligence has good intentions. However, if sensory input is not interpreted correctly then a mere good intention of course does not suffice.

An application called *Markover* can be used to contextualize text within the Grid so that a future heuristic could rely on this user-generated data to read some other text and automatically contextualize it correctly. This would be supposed to reduce contextualization errors such as translating the English phrase "The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak" as the Russian phrase "The vodka is good but the meat is rotten".

Ultimately, Four Mountains could facilitate a supercomputer that stores all peer-reviewed articles, has hierarchically evaluated all statements within them and could automatically peer-review submitted articles. And programs like Markover can be used to transform literature research into a more exact science, possibly also creating employment opportunities if user-generated contextualization does turn out to facilitate a heuristic that's reliable enough to be useful.

Markover is available at http://a.moq.fi. This application only works on Firefox.



How to Use
==========

Currently, Four Mountains is mostly a computer game that accumulates varying kinds of score and can have human players, computer players or both. Humans play the game by clicking on slots of the grid. Upon doing so the player in turn moves into the slot whereas all other players move into a slot whose coordinates are the vector sum of that slot and their current position.

All available slots are colored with the exception of slots that are situated on the axes of the coordinate system. These slots are called nonrelativized and their metaphysical structure is largely unknown. However, mathematical considerations necessitate them as omitting them would be like omitting the number zero from arithmetic. Four Mountains uses these slots as a substitute for an "experience level" system that models social authority. There are four stacks of experience levels and experience level increases when a player is moved, by another player, to a nonrelativized slot that would otherwise be inaccessible for her.
